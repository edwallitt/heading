# Feature ideas

Suggestions from a full codebase review (July 2026). Grouped into three buckets:
finish the half-built things, deepen the "dispatch" fantasy, and give the app
memory without a database.

**Top three picks:** home-base/journey mode (#8), wind-aware routing (#4), and
finishing the navaid waypoint path that's already ~80% built (#1).

---

## Finish what's already half-built (high payoff, low effort)

### 1. Named navaid routing ✅ *(shipped July 2026)*

~10,800 navaids load at boot and the `.pln` writer can resolve them by ident
(`export/waypoints.ts`) — but `validateWaypoints` in
`apps/server/src/ai/generateFlight.ts` only accepts raw `lat,lon` strings, so
the entire navaid path is dead weight. Feed each candidate chain's nearby
VOR/NDB idents into the prompt and accept them back. VFR briefs suddenly read
like real ones ("route via the WHISKEY VOR, then coast-crawl north") and the
`.pln` gets proper named waypoints instead of anonymous coordinates.

Bonus creative reuse: a navaid *on the field* is a decent
instrument-capability signal — better than the current `scheduled_service`
proxy for `ifr_capable`, which is flagged in-code as coarse.

### 2. Multi-leg scenic waypoints ✅ *(shipped July 2026)*

Waypoints are single-leg only; legs 2–3 always fly direct
(`generateFlight.ts`). Multi-leg tours are exactly the flights where scenic
routing matters most.

### 3. Server-side anti-repeat ✅ *(shipped July 2026)*

`excludeRecent` was only a "please avoid" hint in the prompt. It's now also a
ranking signal in `lib/candidatePairs.ts`: `CandidatePairOptions.excludeRecent`
adds a recency penalty as the *top* sort key at all three ranking sites — the
seed-pair sort in `runPipeline` (so fresh seeds get built into chains), the
leg-2+ hop sort in `rankedDestinations`, and the whole-chain sort in
`buildChains` (penalty = count of distinct chain airports in the recent set,
origins included). Freshness wins the tier; vibe/distance still order *within*
each recency tier. Kept honest-relaxation: it only reorders — never filters —
so the relaxation ladder and best-effort pool are untouched, and an empty list
is a byte-for-byte no-op (all current tests stayed green). The prompt hint
stays too — ranking + hint together beats either alone, and the demotion is
what finally makes the *fallback* path (`fallbackChoice` picks `chains[0]`,
never reads the prompt) fresh on regenerate.

## Deepen existing features

### 4. Wind-aware everything

METARs are already fetched for the whole pool but used only for category
demotion. The wind fields are sitting right there:

- Adjust block time for head/tailwind component so the numbers are honest.
- Prefer chains flown *downwind* when the budget is tight.
- Surface it in the card ("18 kt on the tail — you'll beat the block time").

Going further: Open-Meteo serves keyless winds-aloft at pressure levels, which
fits the no-API-key rule and gives real cruise-level winds instead of surface
wind as a proxy.

### 5. TAFs for the golden-hour slot

The golden-hour strip proposes a departure hours from now, but the weather
chips show *current* METARs — the one time the weather is guaranteed stale is
the time the app tells the user to fly. AWC serves TAFs from the same keyless
API; decode the validity window covering the proposed departure and badge the
destination with the *forecast* category alongside the current one.

### 6. Fix the coastal vibe with real coastline data (+ restore Africa) ✅ *(shipped July 2026)*

Both halves done.

**Coastline data.** The ≤50 ft elevation proxy is gone. `build-airports.ts`
now bakes distance-to-coast from Natural Earth's `ne_10m_coastline` (a
gitignored build input, like the CSVs) via a 1° segment grid
(`scripts/lib/coastline.ts`) + planar point-to-segment distance
(`geo.segmentDistanceNm`). "coastal" = within 15 NM of ocean shoreline (chosen
so large lagoon atolls like Rangiroa read coastal while river valleys, which
sit >30 NM out, stay inland). Flip-set vs the old proxy: +1,711 gained
(cliff-top fields it missed — Madeira 192 ft, Mauritius 186 ft, the Dalmatian
islands — plus lagoon atolls), −872 dropped (mostly >50 NM inland —
Sepik/Fraser/Mackenzie river valleys and outback the proxy wrongly tagged).
Known limitation: NE 10m omits the tiniest atolls entirely (e.g. Eniwetok), so
a few strips still lose the coastal bias; lakeshore fields are also excluded by
design (NE coastline is ocean-only).

**Restore Africa.** `regions.ts` maps `AF → "africa"`; the asset regenerated
to +804 African fields and the region is a first-class dial.

### 7. Golden hour is one mode — make it a dial

"Arrive at golden hour" is lovely, but the same sun math (`lib/sun.ts`) gives:

- **Dawn patrol** — lift off in civil twilight, land in morning light.
- **Night VFR** — the city-skyline vibe at night is a different product.
- **Sunset chaser** — westbound at jet speeds you outrun the terminator, so a
  regional-jet leg can stretch golden hour across the whole flight. A
  computable, physical, magical thing no other tool tells you.

## New features that fit the architecture

### 8. Home base + journey mode (top pick)

Simmers overwhelmingly fly from a home field, and the app currently teleports
you somewhere random every time. Two layers, both stateless:

1. Let the user pin an origin ICAO (localStorage, one text input; the pool
   seeds from it in `candidatePairs.ts`).
2. The killer feature on top — **"continue the journey"**: the next brief
   departs wherever the last one landed. The open-chain machinery already does
   exactly this shape of work.

Suddenly Heading isn't a random-flight generator, it's an ongoing world tour
with a persistent line crawling across the map — the emotional difference is
enormous, and it costs a localStorage key.

### 9. Closed loops

The chain builder only does open A→B→C. "There and back" (A→B→A) and
triangles that end at origin are *the* classic sim-session shapes — you want
to end parked at your home hangar. It's a small variant of `extendChain`: the
last leg targets the origin, band-checked like any other leg.

### 10. Challenge modifiers

An optional "spice" dial using data that's already there:

- **Short-field** — destination `longest_rwy_ft` near the aircraft minimum.
- **High & hot** — field elevation + temperature from the METAR.
- **Crosswind work** — needs runway headings baked from `runways.csv`
  (currently only lengths are kept), then compute the crosswind component from
  live wind.

The briefing prose gets to say "gusting 22 across runway 27 — earn it."

### 11. A curated bucket-list tag ✅ *(shipped July 2026)*

A hand-written list of famous airports (Innsbruck, Courchevel, St. Barth,
Paro, Madeira, Saba…) exposed as a `notable` vibe tag with a one-line hook
each. Tiny data, and it gives Opus real material — the briefings for these
write themselves. "Surprise me" occasionally hitting Lukla is worth more than
any algorithmic vibe.

Shipped as `data/notable.ts` (ICAO→hook map, tag applied at load — not baked
into the airport asset, since the list changes on a different cadence). 50
curated fields present in the dataset; the hook text is surfaced per-chain to
the prompt. Grew from 36 to 50 once Africa was restored (#6), adding Cape
Town, Kilimanjaro, Victoria Falls, Réunion, Zanzibar and the African majors.

### 12. Shareable dispatch card

The permalink reproduces the app, but sim communities share *images* on
Discord. Render the result card to a downloadable PNG (canvas, or an OG-image
endpoint on the Hono server so pasted links unfurl with the route map +
briefing). The magenta-on-dark glass-cockpit aesthetic would be instantly
recognizable in a feed — that's the growth loop.

### 13. Local logbook

No accounts, no DB — just a "Mark as flown" button writing to localStorage:
flights flown, NM covered, countries visited, airports lit up on a personal
map. Pairs perfectly with journey mode (#8) to make the whole thing feel like
a career instead of a slot machine.

## Small bug ✅ *(fixed July 2026)*

`regenerating`/`retrying` were hardcoded to `false` in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`,
so the "Generate again" spinner path in `ResultCard` could never trigger. Root
cause was deeper than the hardcoded flag: while `generate.isPending`, App
renders the full-screen `<Dispatching />` and unmounts `ResultCard` entirely,
so the inline spinner was structurally dead. Fixed by deleting the dead path —
`<Dispatching />` already gives regen feedback. (The `retrying` prop stays: the
options-error panel genuinely uses it; only the generate-error `false` was
inert, and it's honest as-is.)

## Suggested sequencing

- **"Your journey" release:** #8 + #9 + #13
- **"Real airmanship" release:** #1 + #4 + #5
- **Quiet data upgrades** that make everything else better: #6 + #11
